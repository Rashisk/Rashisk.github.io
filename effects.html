<ul>
<li> Across the whole world, air pollution has been decreasing drastically. Air and the water in rivers have been getting cleanier; Thanks to the coronavirus lockdowns.</li>
<li>Same effects have been observed in India, where the blue sky is now visible across major cities like :
<ul> <li> <strong>Delhi.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mumbai.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Kolkata.</strong></li></ul> Ganga and Yamuna are flowing cleaner. </li>

<li>Air quality improved largely because of a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and related particulate matter from factories and traffics.</li></ul>

			<ul> 
<li>It imapcts hazardously on almost all the fields such as :
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com">Politics.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.education.com">Education.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com">Religion.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thebalance.com">Economic.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tribuneindia.com">Social.</a></li></ul></li><br/>

<li>Main impact is Global.Global food security expert Peter Alexander of the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk">University of Edinburgh</a> said that the free-market, just-in-time logistical systems common in industrialized areas are very good at dealing with disruptions in one place or sudden shortages of one commodity but are more vulnerable to systemic shock because there is no slack in the system and no supply reserves to fall back on.</li>
<li>Later on, as demand for certain agricultural products fell due to lockdowns and closure of restaurants, famers reported a glut in supply, as <strong>potatoes in the NETHERLANDS</strong> and <strong>milk in the U.S. state of Wisconsin.</strong></li></ul>

<br/><br/>

<p>Although, the liquor shops have been opened as a <strong>measure to collect revenue and taxes to uphold the falling economy,</strong> still <u>this decision is really dangerous</u> as it is  letting people out of their home and <strong>violating social distancing</strong>. This is really not a good decision as the curve of people getting positive  is still rising and this action is actually affecting the efforts taken during the lockdown.
</p>
<p> The Government is imposing more taxes on these quantities to recover their economy, but its. Future impacts are more deadly as we can think now.</p>
<p style="color:red; font-size:25px;">There's still time left ; Stop until its too late...</p>
