<marquee behaviour="alternate" width="100%" style="border:yellow 3px SOLID;"><h1>THANKYOU!</h1></marquee>
<p> We are very thankful to you to go through this information patiently.We hope you have gone through the guidelines properly and will act as a responsible citizen practising social distancing and helping other people in need.
<h2>What you can do for others in this lockdown?</h2> 
<p>Many people still don't know the importance of this lockdown; also, many people are still out on the roads going to their hometowns, walking, due to lack of transport facility.You can do the following things which are possible like:
		<ul>
		<li>Reach out to people via calling and make them understand the importance of lockdown <strong>and tell them to stay at their homes</strong> unless necessary.</li>
		<li><strong>Help those people</strong> who are going to their <strong>hometowns walking</strong> by giving them some <strong>food, water and other essential things</strong>.</li>

		<li>Donate money in <a href="https://www.pmcares.gov.in"> PM Cares </a> and other fundraisers for the people who are in need of help.</li>
		<li><strong>Don't cut</strong> the <strong>daily wages</strong> of the <strong>worker</strong> on your site, <strong>maid</strong> in your house and <strong>salary</strong> of your <strong>employee</strong> working from home!. <strong>They too are suffering</strong> along with you..</li></ul>
<p> We now hope that you have understood the effects of this disease and you will also forward it to others for creating awareness about this harmful disease!</p><br/>
